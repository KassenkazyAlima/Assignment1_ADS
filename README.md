This file provides an overview of my project, including instructions such as building, testing, and running the code.â€¨


My project contains the solution to ten tasks of Laboratory1. And performs the result of them by user's input.For the first two tasks, I didn't use recursion. But it is utilized for tasks starting from the third one.
Instructores: 
Building - complie the Java source file Main.java using Java compilor. 
Testing - after cimpiling th program, run the Main class by Java Interperitor.
Running - execute the compiled Java bytecode by running Java.main in the command line. 

In the start of the Main class, program promots user to enter the number if the task. Accorging the user input, the program executes the cooresponding task, and meanwhile calculates the time taken for execution.


task1() 
In this method, firstly, user inputs a number and an array
task2()
task3()
task4()
task5()
task6()
task7()
task8()
task9()
task10()
