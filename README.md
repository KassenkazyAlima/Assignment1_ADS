This file illustrates an overview of my project, including instructions such as building, testing, and running the code.â€¨


My project contains the solution to ten tasks of Laboratory1. And performs the result of them by user's input.
For the first two tasks, I didn't use recursion. But starting from the third task I used recursion to code the solution for each task.
Each task has been tested by running the Main class and selecting the desired task. After compiling the program, we can run the Main class using the Java interpreter.
